            <p>Hi , Myself Ansh Chawla currently doing a job in my dream company. From an early age I have had passion in electronics and I made projects to solve house hold problems. I have even made a drone during my High School period and got into the FPV domain later in college. To know more about my work visit <a href="#projects">my projects page</a>.</p>
            <p>Apart from electronics, football is one sport I like to play but without rules(because I know none 😜). With this varied liking , I always yern to learn more and more about different sectors of society and look for an alernative approach to solve the current problems like creating a food delivery bot <a href="#swayamsevika">Swayam Sevika</a> for Covid-19 under CSRC department of PEC.  </p>

            <p>So Basically this project was made by a team of people at PEC including me 
                although the code was written by me with the help of other people in the team. 
                The Bot is basically an advanced version of line follower with many failsafes implemented.</p><p> 
                It also had obstacle detection with the help of an ultrasonic sensor. It also had low 
                battery level indication ,Load detection (for detecting when the food was kept on it).
                 The bot could deliver to multiple rooms by push of a button. It also spoke in hindi
                  and english on reaching its destination to let the patient know that his food had
                   arrived.</p>
                   <p> In case Anything went wrong or the User wanted to take control the bot could 
                   be switched into Bluetooth mode and then could be controlled manually. It was made in 
                   such a way so that it could be operated with minimum contact.It had a battery backup 
                   of about 3 days if it delivered 3 meals per day to 50 patients which could be easily extended.

            <section class="imagemain"><img data-src="../images/Esp32/esp32.jpg" alt="Door Bell Picture" ></section>
            <p>This is low cost smart doorbell which is based around an Esp32 micontroller which sends a photo of the person who rang the bell outside the door via Telegram Api.
                It ties into a current doorbell system. </p>
                <p>It detects the doorbell push via a circuit known as capacitive dropper which i used to power an optocoupler which then signals the microcontroller that someone has pushed the bell and hence the microcontroller takes a photo and sends it into a telgram group in which members of the house could be added.</p>
                <p>I also added some configuration/test commands which could be sent to the microcontroller via telegram and debugging or testing could thus be done easily </p>

This program also deleted any repeated case entries, organised the case data in excel file neatly. It used Google's API's(calander and drive Api) .It used libraries such as Gspread , requests , pickle , google o-auth .   </p>

            <!-- <div class="imagemain"><img src="images/AWPS.jpg" alt="" /></div> -->
            <p>So sometimes my mom  forgot to turn off the water pump which fills the overhead water tank of our building from the underground tank , so to solve this issue once and for all I made a water pump system after installation of which the problem was finished. The system basically 
                when powered on would turn the water pump on for about 10 minutes and then would turn it off automatically .For restarting of the water pump the sytem had to be reset which could simply be done by turning the power switch of the system  off for 5 seconds and then turning it back on
                . It also had low water level detection feature so that if during those 10 minutes if the underground tank was to go empty the water pump would be automatically switched off.

            <section class="imagemain"><img src="" data-src="../images/AWL/AWL.jpg" alt="Automatic washroom lights image"></section>
            <p>I wanted to make my washroom lights fully automatic so I set out on journey for finding how to make them automatic. I came up with a circuit based on 555 IC in Monostable configuration .I also added two limit switches one to detect if door was open or not ,and another one to detect If the door was locked or not. The monostable configuraton was used  because there exits a time gap from when a person would closes the washroom door and changes the door lock to engaged , for this time gap the lights should remain on soo i used monostable configuration.
                but i slighly modified it so that the charging of the capacitor would only start when the door was closed and the lock wasn't engaged , had I not modified the circuit the lights would turnoff everynow and then for short interval of time because the capacitor would get charged and then suddenly discharged.   </p>
