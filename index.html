            <p>Hi , Myself Ansh Chawla currently doing a job in my dream company. From an early age I have had passion in electronics
                 and I made projects to solve house hold problems. I have even made a drone during my High School period and got into 
                 the FPV domain later in college. To know more about my work visit <a href="#projects">my projects page</a>.</p>
            <p>Apart from electronics, football is one sport I like to play but without rules(because I know none 😜). 
                With this varied liking , I always yearn to learn more and more about different sectors of society and
                 look for an alternative approach to solve the current problems like creating a food delivery bot <a href="#swayamsevika">Swayam Sevika
                 </a> for Covid-19 under CSRC department of PEC </p>
            <p> One of my proudest moments would be when I made a hovercraft and participated in IIT KANPUR fest the hovercraft was made in less than a week 
                and the one I made had two major features , firstly it could jump (and trust me when it jumped people went crazy ,Checkout the video <a href="#hover">
                    here</a>) and the second one was the we could reverse , this feature was really beneficial for saving your hovercraft when you are at the 
                    edge of the Arena. I would never forget that moment as standing there listening to the audience cheering for you as THE BEST moment.
                    </p>

            <p> So this project was started during the covid time in under the CSRC cell of my college to make a robot 
                that could autonomously sanitize the hospitals as well as after the sanitization of hospital it should 
                sanitize it-self so that we could avoid any sort of covid-19 virus spread. This project was made in 2 
                version , the first one was a very crude and bad looking prototype which had its own flaws (it used to 
                spray a lot of sanitizer). So we made a second version in which we made the whole chassis from scratch ,
                 got it fabricated from the industrial area, it had a custom tank inside this time and used misting nozzles 
                 rather than a agricultural sprayer for spraying the disinfectant. The new version also had sprayers pointing 
                 on itself so that it could spray the sanitizer on itself later.</p>

            <p>So when i started this project my goal was to make a soldering iron controller which can support all sorts of tips from Hakko A1321 to JBC C210 and to make the PCB fit inside a Hakko 936 Soldering iron, and that is what i have accomplished as well. 
                The project was based of some other youtuber's project but i had to make a lot of changes both in HW and SW to add support for all irons + make it commercial. One of my other goals was to make it portable that is why i added a XT60 
                connector as well as USB-C PD support. The circuit is technically capable of going upto 50V DC and was designed with those sort of clearances in mind.  </p>

            <p>So Basically this project was made by a team of people at PEC including me 
                although the code was written by me with the help of other people in the team. 
                The Bot is basically an advanced version of line follower with many failsafes implemented.</p><p> 
                It also had obstacle detection with the help of an ultrasonic sensor. It also had low 
                battery level indication ,Load detection (for detecting when the food was kept on it).
                 The bot could deliver to multiple rooms by push of a button. It also spoke in hindi
                  and english on reaching its destination to let the patient know that his food had
                   arrived.</p>
                   <p> In case Anything went wrong or the User wanted to take control the bot could 
                   be switched into Bluetooth mode and then could be controlled manually. It was made in 
                   such a way so that it could be operated with minimum contact.It had a battery backup 
                   of about 3 days if it delivered 3 meals per day to 50 patients which could be easily extended.

            <p>This is low cost smart doorbell which is based around an Esp32 micontroller which sends a photo of the person who rang the bell outside the door via Telegram Api.
                It ties into a current doorbell system. </p>
                <p>It detects the doorbell push via a circuit known as capacitive dropper which i used to power an optocoupler which then signals the microcontroller that someone has pushed the bell and hence the microcontroller takes a photo and sends it into a telegram group in which members of the house could be added.</p>
                <p>I also added some configuration/test commands which could be sent to the microcontroller via telegram and debugging or testing could thus be done easily </p>

            <!-- <div class="imagemain"><img src="images/AWPS.jpg" alt="" /></div> -->
            <p>So sometimes my mom  forgot to turn off the water pump which fills the overhead water tank of our building from the underground tank , so to solve this issue once and for all I made a water pump system after installation of which the problem was finished. The system basically 
                when powered on would turn the water pump on for about 10 minutes and then would turn it off automatically .For restarting of the water pump the system had to be reset which could simply be done by turning the power switch of the system  off for 5 seconds and then turning it back on
                . It also had low water level detection feature so that if during those 10 minutes if the underground tank was to go empty the water pump would be automatically switched off.

            <section class="imagemain"><img src="" data-src="../images/AWL/AWL.jpg" alt="Automatic washroom lights image"></section>
            <p>I wanted to make my washroom lights fully automatic so I set out on journey for finding how to make them automatic. I came up with a circuit based on 555 IC in Monostable configuration .I also added two limit switches one to detect if door was open or not ,and another one to detect If the door was locked or not. The monostable configuraton was used  because there exits a time gap from when a person would closes the washroom door and changes the door lock to engaged , for this time gap the lights should remain on soo i used monostable configuration.
                but i slightly modified it so that the charging of the capacitor would only start when the door was closed and the lock wasn't engaged , had I not modified the circuit the lights would turnoff everynow and then for short interval of time because the capacitor would get charged and then suddenly discharged.   </p>

            <p>This was my cycle to which I added lights and music system.I wanted myself to be visible in dark so that i could avoid accidents .I also didn't want to use earphones while riding as they can be dangerous so I added speakers as well </p>

            <h2>CRSF logic analyzer</h2>
            <p>This was a high level logic analyzer extension originally started by Max on github and I further continued and completed the project to a stable point. The extension basically analyses the packet of a CRSF protocol and displays its meaning after decoding it. It also checks for CRC errors if there are any. </p>

            <p>This was a hovercraft made by a team of 5 people for the hovermania competition at IIT Kanpur. We unfortunately didn't win any prize but enjoyed the competition as well as Building this hovercraft.</p>
            <p>Some key features of the hovercraft that were added into the V2 were the reversing of the both motors, This allows us to create a suction on the ground, so that the competitor cannot push you over the edge. The reversing of the thrust motor allows you to go in the reverse direction which is useful if you get stuck in a corner.</p>
            <p>This reversing of motor was only possible because we used DSHOT600 protocol for communicating with the ESC. This protocol was emulated/ works using timers of the STM32 in PWM mode alongside DMA(direct memory access) feature. So duty cycle numbers are loaded from the memory on the fly and the DSHOT600 signal is generated. This was quite hard as there was little to no documentation for the DSHOT600 protocol.</p>

            <p>This was a drone made for the competition Flipkart grid 4.0 held in IIT madras. We were supposed to make a drone which could autonomously pickup and drop objects using aruco markers. We Firstly used a APM flight controller in combination with a raspberry pi 3 and made the raspberry pi 3 control the drone using PWM signals which are standard signals for many flight controllers. We switched between the PWM signals of the user and Raspberry pi using a mux with a duty cycle detector so that we could take control from raspberry pi wirelessly at any time. Later we left the APM flight controller and moved onto a custom FC using a teensy duino 4.0 for which we found a basic flight controller firmware online. We modified the firmware so that Raspberry pi could control it over I2C and it could receive height data over UART from 2 ultrasonic sensors connected to an arduino. Well you may ask Did we win the competition ? No we didn't , but did we learn and enjoy making that drone ? Absolutely Yes we loved it.</p>
            <p> This project ultimately lead to me taking up and making a <a href="#DIYFC">custom firmware</a> for drones from scratch</p>
